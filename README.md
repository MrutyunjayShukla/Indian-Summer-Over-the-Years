## Problem Statement
The consequences of climate change on the social systems are expected to vary in different parts of India on account of several regional and other local factors. Therefore, different modelling studies, adaptation strategies and technology systems would be required in differing geographical and social contexts.
The Government of India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) on 30th June 2008. It helps in providing an improved understanding and awareness of the key climate processes and the resultant climate risks and associated consequences. Indian Summers (April to June) are extremely Hot and Humid. Surprisingly, (or not so), 2022 is hotter, not just in the usual cities across the country, but also in places that normally are known for warm temperatures.
You have been consulted to present a forecasting report to predict daily temperature for the upcoming summer using the dataset below.
Below is the path for the data.

You have been consulted to present the report results to the current Deputy Secretary in charge of the climate change Programme committee in India. With the given context, you need to create a dashboard using TABLEAU. (Use the concepts learned in the class). Handle the missing data as part of data preprocessing and mention how it is handled.

## Importing data 

The Dataset was downloaded from Data.gov.in, and then imported data to Tableau

## Data Preparation 

- Validation of each column Data Type
- Removing Unnecessary Rows and Columns
- Missing Values Treatment
